\fontsize{13}{16}\selectfont

\subsection{Context}
\hspace*{1em}A Distributed database is a database shared by multiple servers or computers instead of limited to one system. Inside a Distributed database system, each component contains its own database connected with other databases. A Distributed database has higher benefits than a centralized database system as it provides faster data processing between sites. It also ensures that the system can still execute if one or more sites fail to operate.

\hspace*{1em}One of the most important parts of a Distributed database is Replication. Replication is a method used for storing data. In the Replication approach, systems maintain copies of data stored in multiple sites instead of only one main copy in the main site. With Replication, data can be accessed at different sites in parallel. The system is also ensured to continue to operate even if a server fails as there are copies of the same data on different other servers. 

\hspace*{1em}Following the Replication method, MySQL Replication is a process that can automatically copy data from one MySQL server to other replica servers. The replica servers are proposed to be updated from the source’s data. 

\hspace*{1em}The efficient synergy between MySQL and the Replication method is widely used for numerous purposes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Balancing Loads: Queries can be redirected to replica servers in order to reduce the load on the source server.
    \item System Availability: MySQL Replication can ensure the source system can still operate in case one or more servers fail to operate.
    \item Backup Solution: Replica servers can be used for backups without interaction with the main database.
    \item Disaster Recovery: A replica server can be quickly promoted to the primary server in the event of catastrophic failures.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objectives}
\hspace*{1em}Our main objective is building a MySQL Master-Slave Replication system. The system can copy and update data from a primary database (Master database) to one or more secondary databases (Slave databases). The Master database will receive all write operations including inserts, updates, deletions, etc… After the Master database is modified, a copy of it will be kept in a Slave database. The copy process will be executed automatically whenever the master database is altered.

\subsection{Outcomes}
\hspace*{1em}A MySQL Master-Slave Replication system can automatically copy the Master database to a Slave database every time the Master database is modified.

\section{\bfseries Methodology}
\fontsize{13}{16}\selectfont
\subsection{System Architecture}
The architecture for the system is based on the Master-Slave model. The system will include the following components:

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{distribute_system_architecture.png}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Master Database:} 
    \item \textbf{Binary Log:}
    \item \textbf{Master Server:}
    \item \textbf{Redis:}
    \item \textbf{Slave Server:}
    \item \textbf{Slave Database:}
\end{itemize}

Both Master server and all Slave servers are assigned a unique identifier to avoid conflicts of operation between servers.

\subsection{Role Assignments}
Each kind of server has a defined role for maintain the system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Master Server:} Master server is responsible for all data changes, including INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.. It logs every transactions for storing data in Slave servers.
    \item \textbf{Slave Server:} Slave server is responsible for managing copies of Master server. Slave servers are also enabled for read operations without interaction with the Master server. 
\end{itemize}
